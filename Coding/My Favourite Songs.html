  <h1> <b><u>Favourite Songs</u></b>  </h1>  
  <p><h2>Everyone has an interest in their own way. Some of us like dance and some in karate. But some are really intrested in songs. Songs are very helpful for reducing stress. Its very pleasent to hear soft music and sometimes exciting to here loud music. But songs and music have no language. It depends how we feel it. Music is just felt by heart and is sung by heart. This is what makes music very beautiful.</h2> </p>
