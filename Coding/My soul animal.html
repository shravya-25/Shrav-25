    <title>My soul animal</title>

<body>
   <p><h1> If I had an option to choose which animal I would become a "Butterfly"</h1>
    <h2>Butterfly is very beutiful. But not only because its beutiful but it can fly to any place in the world. I too wan to fly all over the world and enjoy seeing the valleys full of flowers, Gardens full of greenery, forests with waterfalls and many more yet to discover. I would love doing so.</h2> </p>
    
<p><h3>Seeing as a human, walking on the feet is actually a very nice experience. But seeing places as a butterfly will be more intreseting according to me. It would actually be more unforgetteble if compared. Flying to the places and reaching up to the sky!! It would actually be very nice. And I have ussually seen babies and small kids are always fond of colourful butterflies. So being butterfly I could even play with them.</h3></p>
    
<p><h2> Thus that's why i want to become a butterfly if i get a chance to become. </h4>
